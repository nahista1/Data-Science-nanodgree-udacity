This is a repository for my Data Scientist Nanodegree Projects.

# 1. Data Science Blog Post
In this project, I did the analysis of [Stack Overflow Survey Data 2017]. (https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)You can find my Medium Blog Post in this link for the full report. The jupyter notebook for this project is located in folder 1 - Data Science Blog Post.

Because the data for this project is quite big and I could not put it in the github repository, you can download the data from [website]. We are going to use the 'survey_results_public.csv file'.



### Libraries
To be able to run this notebook, you need to install these libraries:
- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn)
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)

### Introduction
In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019. This is a survey data which I took from their [website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). This data contains nearly 90,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the `Data Science Blog Post.ipynb` file.

For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:
1. Which country has the highest job satisfaction for developers ?
2. Is there the difference in job satisfaction between developers whose undergraduate major is IT-related an those who are not ?
3. Is there any differences in terms of salary between people who contribute to open source and those who are not?

### Result Summary
After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:
1. United States has the highest job satisfaction level for developers in the world, and 5 of top 10 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in Europe.
2. Developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction.
3. Developers who contribute more to the open source have the higher salary (although ”does it have the direct causation?” is still debatable).
