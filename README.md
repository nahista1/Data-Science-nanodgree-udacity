# Data-Science-nanodgree-udacity

This is a repository for my Data Scientist Nanodegree Projects.

# 1. Data Science Blog Post
In this project, I did the analysis of [Stack Overflow Survey Data 2017]. (https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017)You can find my Medium Blog Post in this link for the full report. The jupyter notebook for this project is located in folder 1 - Data Science Blog Post.

Because the data for this project is quite big and I could not put it in the github repository, you can download the data from [here]. We are going to use the 'survey_results_public.csv file'.
